Use xyz ('test.xyz') to generate atom separated representations using representation.py

>>> from representation import get_representation
>>> get_representation('test.xyz')

This generates rep_$i.txt , $i=C,N,O,F (if present in molecule)
Each rep_$i.txt contains n-lines (for a molecule containiing n $i atoms). Representationsof each atom are separated by '\n'
Each line has 128-features separated by commas ','
